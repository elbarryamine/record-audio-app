When considering whether to add a component here, ensure itâ€™s truly necessary.
The types of components that belong here include:

1 - Conversion Components: Components that wrap native React Native components,
transforming them into components that use Shopify Restyle.

3 - Utility Components: Components that import other components to perform
a specific function.

Note: These components should be generic, not tied to the app itself.
Think of them as reusable pieces that you might want to copy and paste into another project.
This will help you determine whether a component should be added here or not.
